# apple_health_trend_plotting
This to help make/generate trends based on exporting a .XML file from Apple Health App. 
This repository provides a set of R scripts to import, process, visualize, and interactively explore your Apple Health data. It is designed to take your raw Apple Health XML export, convert it to a clean Excel summary, generate high-quality PNG scatter plots for multiple health metrics, and launch a Shiny app for interactive visualization.

  Imports and parses raw Apple Health XML export data, then creates a cleaned Excel summary (`apple_health_daily_summary.xlsx`).

- `apple_health_plots.Rmd`  
  Reads the Excel summary and generates scatter plot PNG files for a variety of numeric health metrics over recent months.

- `app.R`  
  A Shiny app script that visualizes the same data interactively with detailed scatter plots, trend lines, and regression stats.

- `activeenergy_sep2024_may2025.png` `activeenergy_sep2024_may2025.pdf` 
  An example output PNG generated by `apple_health_plots.R` to illustrate the visual style and content.

- `apple_health_daily_summary.xlsx` *(not included)*  
  The Excel summary file generated by `apple_health_import.R` and required by the other scripts.
