# apple_health_trend_plotting
This to help make/generate trends based on exporting a .XML file from Apple Health App. 
This repository provides a set of R scripts to import, process, visualize, and interactively explore your Apple Health data. It is designed to take your raw Apple Health XML export, convert it to a clean Excel summary, generate high-quality PNG scatter plots for multiple health metrics, and launch a Shiny app for interactive visualization.
